### Future Enhancements
1. **Additional Data Sources**
   - Plan to integrate more APIs (e.g., Google Analytics, HubSpot, etc.).
   - Ensure compatibility with BigQuery schemas.

2. **Expanded Reporting Layers**
   - Consider additional tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) for broader reporting options.

3. **Automated Data Pipelines**
   - Schedule regular updates from APIs to BigQuery.
   - Ensure robust error handling for API failures.

4. **Data Governance**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) in Looker and BigQuery.
   - Maintain data quality checks during pipeline processing.

### Notes
- Current setup supports real-time or near real-time reporting for the connected data sources.
- BigQuery serves as a scalable and secure data warehouse for current and future needs.
